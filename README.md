# newMacSetup

Here are the steps I take in setting up a new macOS (similar with Linux server).  I have borrowed heavily from the following sources:

## Setup Steps

1. Install xcode command line:  ``` xcode-select --install ```
2. Add homebrew:  ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)" ```
3. Add packages from Brewfile:  ```brew bundle```
